This Python code generates a valid Liverpool FC QueueIT token, which allows you to access and scrape the Liverpool FC ticketing website. You can use this code as a foundational building block to develop an account generator for Liverpool FC ticketing. 

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [Urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
- [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [CapSolver](https://capsolver.com/)

You'll also need a list of proxies for anonymous web requests. You can store them in a `proxies.txt` file.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests urllib3 faker capsolver
   ```

3. Populate the `proxies.txt` file with your list of proxies.

4. [Sign up](https://capsolver.com/) for CapSolver to solve reCAPTCHA challenges.

## Usage

In the code, you'll find the `test` function, which demonstrates how to use the code to obtain a QueueIT token and create an account. You can use this function as a starting point for your project.

Here's how to run the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    processes = []
    for _ in range(10):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=test)
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    # Wait for all processes to finish
    for process in processes:
        process.join()
```

This code launches multiple processes, each attempting to obtain a QueueIT token and create an account. You can adjust the number of processes as needed.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to replace the placeholder values such as `USER_AGENT`, `SITE_KEY`, and `API_KEY` with your actual values.

- The code contains functions for solving reCAPTCHA challenges using CapSolver. Ensure that your CapSolver credentials are correctly configured.

- The generated accounts are stored in the `accounts.txt` file.
